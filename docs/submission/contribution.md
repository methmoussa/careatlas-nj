# CareAtlas NJ: contribution and provenance

CareAtlas helps New Jersey residents move from a town name to a small-area screening explanation, the official evidence behind it, and a shareable record. Its contribution is the integration and explanation layer: consistent geographic identifiers, explicit missing values, a readable rule, tract-to-town context and resident-facing briefs. It does not claim to invent the source indicators or to predict individual healthcare outcomes.

  F --> G[Explanation, sources, shared URL and exports]
  H[ACS context; HRSA and CMS facilities] --> G
```

The original source publishers supply the measurements and boundaries. CareAtlas imports and normalizes them, preserves provenance, evaluates the published decision logic, validates generated records and serves county-sized files to a React/Leaflet interface. Facility and specialist-office pins provide separate context and never determine a gap flag.

## Pinned sources

Dates below describe metadata in the repository, not claims that every source was refreshed on September 14. Source archives and maintenance scripts remain in the repository; runtime packaging excludes staging and fixtures.

For exact per-family counts and source URLs, inspect `public/data/tracts/nj/*coverage-summary.json`, `public/data/tracts/nj/town-foundation/summary.json`, each facility's provenance and `public/data/doctor-offices/nj.json`. Specialty counts overlap when an office offers multiple specialties.

## Development and AI assistance

The author confirms that implementation began **August 1, 2026** and that substantially the same project has never been entered elsewhere. GitHub history begins September 5, when an existing local worktree was uploaded in installments through September 12. Those commits document publication of the worktree, not day-by-day development. September 13 cleanup made local setup and tests self-contained. September 14 review corrected SVI labels, broadened print availability and added this submission package.

The imported worktree contains earlier June/July date fields in source, review and generated artifacts, including CareAtlas-specific planning and promotion reports. The author confirms that those fields do **not** record implementation activity. They remain visible rather than being silently rewritten, and they must not be presented as development milestones. Because no contemporaneous pre-import Git history is available, the August 1 start is an author attestation rather than an independently verified date. See the [methods review](methods-review.md).

OpenAI ChatGPT/Codex assisted with code changes, debugging, tests, repository organization, documentation, browser QA and submission preparation. Gemini is an optional runtime explanation feature; it is disabled on the live site as checked September 14. It does not calculate flags. Do not claim the project was written without AI assistance or that AI review supplied human validation.

Suggested Built With: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet, React Leaflet, Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, Vitest, Census/TIGERweb/ACS, CDC PLACES, CDC/ATSDR SVI, HRSA, CMS/NPPES, OpenAI ChatGPT/Codex; optional Google Gemini integration (disabled in this demo).
