# CareAtlas submission package

Updated September 17, 2026. This package documents completed engineering work and remaining evidence gaps; it is not a claim that all submission requirements or outside validation are complete.

## Ready to review

- [Live demo recording script](demo-recording-script.md): a four-minute sequence with exact actions and narration for the author's new recording.
- [Devpost draft](devpost-draft.md): prepared public copy, asset links, and the remaining submission checklist. The entry has not been submitted and its final video is still pending.
- [Narrated walkthrough](assets/careatlas-walkthrough.mp4): 3 minutes 17 seconds, 1280×720, English synthetic narration. It uses actual application screenshots, not a continuous screen recording. No actors, resident testimonials or expert endorsements are depicted.
- [Interactive walkthrough](walkthrough.html), with [editable narration](walkthrough.json). Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:5173/docs/submission/walkthrough.html`. Use the arrow buttons or arrow keys. The HTML preview is a repository document, not a production app route.
- [Contribution and source inventory](contribution.md): pipeline, source versions, attribution, development chronology and AI assistance.
- [Technical methods review](methods-review.md), including [reproducible sensitivity results](sensitivity.json). Re-run with `node scripts/reviewScreeningSensitivity.mjs`.
- [Browser review](browser-review.md): five agent-operated scenarios, observed fixes and explicit testing limits.
- Submission screenshots: [Newark facility map](assets/newark-facility-map.png), [Edison dermatology offices](assets/edison-dermatology-offices.png), [tract explanation](assets/tract.png), [town search](assets/search.png), [Newark summary](assets/newark.png), [source evidence](assets/sources.png), [export controls](assets/export.png), [mobile missing evidence](assets/mobile-missing.png). The September 17 facility screenshot is a clean, unedited copy of the author's capture.

## Validation and fixes

September 15 branding update: replaced the favicon/site mark with a navy-and-teal location pin and care cross using the site's existing palette. The matching 3:2 [project card](assets/careatlas-brand-card.png), with editable [SVG source](assets/careatlas-brand-card.svg), is saved as the Devpost thumbnail. Selected UI, public-map, safety-copy and build checks passed. Cloudflare deployment `6e62052c-3ac8-4d40-88b0-851607a9bcb4` was visually verified on the live site. The GitHub repository is now public with the owner's explicit approval. The competition entry remains unsubmitted, and the video URL remains blank.

The September 16 repository cleanup passed the complete `npm test` suite. This included 35 UI tests across six files, source/data/importer checks, the source-size guard, production build, local HTTP checks, bundle/performance checks, and the Cloudflare packaging dry run. `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported no vulnerabilities. Hosted GitHub Actions was not run in this local review. The walkthrough MP4 had previously been decoded successfully through its entire 3:17 duration.

Two changes resulted from this review: SVI values are correctly labeled as New Jersey percentiles, and loaded results can be printed even when they are not flagged. The SVI source comparison checked all 10,905 published observations against the pinned state file, finding zero numeric/missing-value mismatches. The sensitivity analysis reproduced all 2,181 current classifications.

The fixes were deployed to the [live site](https://careatlas.lmayzel930.workers.dev) on September 14, Cloudflare version `69594279-2558-48a6-913f-8e07ed733abb`. A live browser check confirmed Print brief on tract 19 and the corrected New Jersey percentile wording. All 47 changed data files were compared with the prior Git revision and contained only the intended SVI text corrections.

## Remaining submission work and validation

| Item | Actual status |
| --- | --- |
| Five resident sessions | **0 completed.** Agent scenarios do not count as residents. |
| Independent public-health/GIS methods review | **0 completed.** The AI desk review is not external expert validation. |
| Native download / print preview / clipboard round trip | Browser bridge did not expose completion; end-to-end verification remains open. |
| Development chronology | Author confirms an August 1 implementation start. Git begins September 5 with staged uploads of an existing local worktree; preserved June/July fields in imported artifacts are disclosed as non-development metadata. The start date is author-attested, not independently verified by Git history. |
| Dataset reuse notices | Source and general publisher policies documented; dataset-specific HRSA grant not verified. |
| Public repository access | Public visibility authorized by the author and verified in GitHub on September 15, 2026. |
| Hosted demo video and Devpost submission | Devpost draft gallery saved and previewed in this order: brand card, Newark facility map, Edison dermatology offices, tract evidence. Author will record a new live demo using the script; video URL intentionally blank. No final submission. |

Use the [resident and expert kit](../outside-review-kit.md) for the remaining human work. Real sessions should record task outcomes and misunderstandings, including unsuccessful attempts. The author's own feedback can improve the app but cannot stand in for five outside residents. A public quote requires permission for the exact attribution; anonymous aggregate observations can be reported without inventing testimonials.

Before submitting, compare the entry against the organizer's [current rules](https://gibc-v2.devpost.com/rules), including repository access, video hosting, screenshots, participant eligibility and disclosure requirements. The repository is public; the competition entry has not been submitted.
